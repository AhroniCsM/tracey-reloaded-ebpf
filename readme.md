# Tracey Reloaded

Tracey Reloaded is a dummy Kubernetes-based application designed to generate logs, metrics and traces for a 'simulated' warehouse operations. It is intended to be used with OpenTelemetry for the collection of telemetry data and shipping on to Coralogix. The application consists of multiple services: 

## Architecture

### Services

- **Warehouse Interface**: This service acts as the front-end interface for warehouse operations, it simulates order and stock requests on a loop and randomly generates errors. 

- **Order Processor**: Responsible for processing orders, this service handles recieves HTTP requests from Warehouse Interface and communicates with the PostgreSQL database to add and remove orders. 

- **Stock Processor**: Responsible for processing stock, this service handles recieves HTTP requests from Warehouse Interface and communicates with the PostgreSQL database to add and remove stock. 

- **PostgreSQL Database**: A centralized database service that stores has 2 tables, one for orders and one for stock.
